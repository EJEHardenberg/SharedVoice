SharedVoice
=======================================================================

**What about side by side with a friend?** - _Legolas_ 

### What is this? 

SharedVoice is an extremely simple Twitter Application that allows
yourself and friends to post the same tweet at the same time. It's easy
to setup, install the database schema, pick a time, and then add a
cronjob to your server. 

The application consists of: 

- a front end (to allow the tweet to be posted) 
- a back end PHP using [twitteroauth] to authorize 
- a script to run to tweet whatever you'd like from all accounts signed
  up

### What is this not?

This is not a spamming application, though it could definitely be used
to setup a bunch of twitter accounts. The intended purpose is for
activists who want to show solidarity on twitter. By uniting their
voices they're able to reach a larger audience then they may alone.

### Why are you making this?

Because everyone needs something to do in their spare time and I rather
possibly assist someone trying to make a difference in the world then
look at cat pictures. 

### Who can use this?

Anyone. Download the code, follow the setup instructions and go to town.
The setup file isn't detailed for the complete newbie to tech, but if
you've got google you'll be just fine.
